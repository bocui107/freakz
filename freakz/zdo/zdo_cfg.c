    \brief ZDO configuration manager

    This file holds the functions that set and retrieve the descriptors that
    describe the configuration of this device. It also contains functions that
    set /changethe configuration for this device.

    Each device must contain the
    following standard descriptors:
    - Node descriptor - type and capabilities of the node
    - Power descriptor - power characteristics of the node

    There are also optional descriptors such as:
    - User descriptor - user defined descriptor
    - Complex descriptor - further detailed information about the device and descriptors
