    \brief Non fragmenting dynamic memory allocation heap controller

        This is the main file that implements the non-fragmenting dynamic
        memory allocation. Fragmentation is a major issue with embedded systems
        because they tend to leave holes in memory as you do multiple mallocs
        and frees. Eventually, your memory ends up looking like swiss cheeses
        and you will get to a point where you may have the necessary amount
        of free memory but it won't be contiguous. Hence, your malloc will fail
        and your program will crash and burn.

        Non fragmenting dynamic memory allocation uses Contiki's mmem.c managed
        memory library. It actually implements a pointer to a pointer to a memory
        block. A pointer to a pointer is called a handle. Hence the handle will
        always point to the real memory block pointer. However every time a mem
        block is freed, the memory will get compacted and made contiguous, hence
        removing any holes. Since the memory blocks can move around, you will need
        the handle to tell you the real instaneous position of the memory.
