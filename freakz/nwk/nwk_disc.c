    \brief NWK discovery 

    This file handles the network discovery functions for the NWK layer.
    It will basically initiate an active scan in the mac layer, and the
    received beacons will be sent here to be processed. When the network
    discovery is complete, it will issue the confirm to the ZDO layer.

    This function will start a network discovery operation. It will start an active scan
    which records all the networks on the given channels. Once the scan is finished,
    it will call mlme_scan_confirm which will then send the results up to the ZDO.
