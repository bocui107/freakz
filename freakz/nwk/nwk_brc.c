    \brief NWK broadcast handler

    This file handles the NWK layer broadcasts. Broadcasts are a fairly
    complicated affair in Zigbee and require a sequence of actions. It goes
    something like this:
    - A data request comes in from the APS layer with a broadcast address for
    a destination.
    - Start the broadcast sequence by setting flags to indicate that
    a broadcast is in progress and disallowing new broadcasts to start.
    - Send out the broadcast
    - Receive the relayed frames from the nodes that we sent the broadcast to. Since
    the broadcasts are forwarded, we should receive one broadcast from each node
    within listening range.
    - Each received broadcast goes into our broadcast table to record the fact
    that we received the broadcast from the node. This is called passive ack'ing
    in the Zigbee spec.
    - We're supposed to send out the broadcast a certain number of times, however
    the software will stop transmitting when we have received a broadcast from
    all of our neighbors.

    Broadcasts need to be treated with a lot of care in Zigbee because there is
    the potential for them to spiral out of control and crash all the nodes
    on the network.

        List head for the broadcast table. When a broadcast is sent, we receive
        return broadcasts containing the same information. The broadcast table
        implements a passive ack mechanism where we can check if all of our neighbors
        sent the broadcast back to us. If anyone missed it, we will then re-send 
        the broadcast.

        It's actually kind of stupid. A broadcast is unreliable so I'm still not clear
        on why we need to implement this waste of space. But anyways, here it is.
