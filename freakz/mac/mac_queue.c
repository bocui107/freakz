    \brief MAC rx queue controller

    This file handles the MAC's rx queue. When a valid frame comes into the
    radio, the rx ISR will be called and the frame will be added to the queue.
    After that, an event will be posted to the mac process and the mac's eventhandler
    will pull the frame from the rx queue.
